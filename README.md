# GMax
GMax A high-level programming language created By Aswin Murali.
GMax is a Powerful, Cross-Platform, Easy to use Programming Language created
by a 13 year old boy. GMax is a widely used high-level, general-purpose,
interpreted, dynamic programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes
code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts
in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java.
The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs
on both a small and large scale.

### About
GMax is an easy to use high-level programming language created
by Aswin Murali a 13 year old boy. He started the development
in 2016 August. GMax is used for both scientific and non-scientific
purpose. Most programming language’s coding discipline is strict
but GMax has a loose type discipline which makes it easy for the
beginners to use. It has the combined power of both loose type
and strict type. That is, it also displays errors (strict type)
and at the same time it can run even if there is an error (loose type).
GMax is available on all platforms, Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, Web
and many more. GMax is interpreted language which makes debugging more
easily than compiled languages. GMax also has a compiler to compile code
to scripts to valid exe or AST code.

### Code Technology
Most programming language converts codes form source to machine.
But GMax uses AST code (Abstract Syntax Tree Code) which is the
GMax virtual instruction. GMax uses AST, A compiled form of
GMax code to make it completely portable, so that it makes your
compiled code available on all platforms where GMax is present.  

### Speed
As we said earlier, GMax compiles code to AST rather than machine code.
This might affect the speed of the program but don’t worry.
GMax has many tools to convert your compiled AST codes to Native
codes and GMax also has a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that makes
the code faster than normal performance. 

### Powerful
GMax is not a small language. It’s powerful with support for
OpenGL, Cross-Platform Tk GUI, Powerful GMGame modules.
To develop Games, Apps, Websites, Web Apps, Web Games, Backend-Programs etc.
